/**
 * Usage:
 *
 * Inside of a struct for which you want to use safe casting, place the string
 * "SAGE_TYPE". Then, whenever you allocate an instance of that struct use the
 * "s_alloc" macro, and whenever you cast to that struct use the "s_cast" macro,
 * being sure to check the return value.
 *
 * The s_cast macro requires access to the struct's fields, so out-of-the-box
 * sage types cannot be used to cast opaque structures. You can get around this
 * by defining the macro SAGE_USE_OFFSET_0. If you define this make sure that
 * in your sage structs you have "SAGE_TYPE" as the FIRST thing in your struct,
 * otherwise things will not behave as expected.
 *
 * You can turn off type checking if you want for release builds and the like by
 * defining the NO_SAGE_TYPES macro.
